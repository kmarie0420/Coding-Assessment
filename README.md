Coding Assessment 

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score


## Description
I am creating a timed "Coding Assessment" application with a highscore ranking. The questions are multiple choice. As well as timed. Each wrong answer will be penalized by 10 seconds. All clickable buttons functions. With a chance to submit you score in a potential view highscore library.
